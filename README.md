# DeeplearningTensorflow
Deep learning using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Intro to Deep Learning

1. [A Single Neuron](intro_to_deep_learning/01-a-single-neuron.ipynb)   
Learn about linear units, the building blocks of deep learning.

2. [Deep Neural Networks](intro_to_deep_learning/02-deep-neural-networks.ipynb)   
Add hidden layers to your network to uncover complex relationships.

3. [Stochastic Gradient Descent](intro_to_deep_learning/03-stochastic-gradient-descent.ipynb)   
Use Keras and Tensorflow to train your first neural network.

4. [Overfitting and Underfitting](intro_to_deep_learning/04-overfitting-and-underfitting.ipynb)   
Improve performance with extra capacity or early stopping.

5. [Dropout and Batch Normalization](intro_to_deep_learning/05-dropout-and-batch-normalization.ipynb)   
Add these special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.

6. [Binary Classification](intro_to_deep_learning/06-binary-classification.ipynb)   
Apply deep learning to another common task.
